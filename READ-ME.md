## About Me 
 My name is Michelle Kurgat.I'm a telecommunications engineer with a deep-seated love for the ever-evolving world of technology.
Throughout my career, I've been captivated by the intricate web of connections that keep us all connected, 
striving to make communication more efficient and accessible. However, along the way, 
I stumbled upon another passion that has ignited my creative spirit - web development. 
Building websites and crafting digital experiences has become my newfound love, allowing me 
to bridge the gap between the physical and digital realms. With a unique blend of telecommunications 
expertise and web development skills, 
I'm eager to continue exploring and contributing to the dynamic landscape of technology.
